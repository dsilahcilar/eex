```yaml
id: unique_identifier
name: 'Action Name'
description: 'Detailed description'
type: 'process'
implementation_complexity: 'LOW|MEDIUM|HIGH'
time_investment: 'LOW|MEDIUM|HIGH'
cost_investment: 'LOW|MEDIUM|HIGH'

expected_outcomes:
  - 'Outcome 1'
  - 'Outcome 2'

implementation_steps:
  - 'Step 1'
  - 'Step 2'

success_metrics:
  - 'Metric 1'
  - 'Metric 2'

resources_needed:
  - 'Resource 1'
  - 'Resource 2'
```

## Available Actions
- **CI/CD Pipeline Enhancement**: Deployment automation and reliability
- **Quality Assurance Framework**: Testing and quality control
- **Workflow Optimization**: Development process efficiency
- **Deployment Safety Measures**: Deployment risk management
- **Process Automation Initiative**: Manual process automation

## Relationships
The relationships between remediation actions and driving factors are defined in the driving factors' YAML files. Each relationship specifies:
- Whether it's a primary or secondary solution
- The impact level (HIGH/MEDIUM/LOW)
