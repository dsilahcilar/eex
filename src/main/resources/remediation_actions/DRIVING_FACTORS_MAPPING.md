# Driving Factors to Remediation Categories Mapping

This document maps driving factors to their primary remediation action categories, helping teams identify the most relevant solutions for specific challenges.

## Testing & Quality
- **Service Integration Issues**
  - Primary: Contract testing, integration testing
  - Secondary: Observability improvements
- **Technical Debt Burden**
  - Primary: Code quality improvements, test coverage
  - Secondary: Development process changes
- **Test Coverage Gaps**
  - Primary: Test coverage improvements
  - Secondary: Training and culture changes

## Observability & Monitoring
- **System Reliability Issues**
  - Primary: Monitoring and observability
  - Secondary: Chaos engineering
- **Incident Response Time**
  - Primary: Monitoring alerts
  - Secondary: Process improvements
- **Production Stability**
  - Primary: System monitoring
  - Secondary: Development process changes

## Development Process
- **Deployment Risk**
  - Primary: Feature flags, CI/CD
  - Secondary: Testing improvements
- **Integration Delays**
  - Primary: Trunk-based development
  - Secondary: Automation improvements
- **Release Complexity**
  - Primary: Feature flags
  - Secondary: Process improvements

## Developer Experience
- **Tooling Friction**
  - Primary: Development environment improvements
  - Secondary: Automation
- **Manual Process Overhead**
  - Primary: Task automation
  - Secondary: Process improvements
- **Development Environment Issues**
  - Primary: Environment standardization
  - Secondary: Tooling improvements

## Culture & Process
- **Unclear Requirements**
  - Primary: Requirements refinement
  - Secondary: Communication improvements
- **Knowledge Sharing Gaps**
  - Primary: Training programs
  - Secondary: Documentation improvements
- **Team Collaboration Issues**
  - Primary: Process improvements
  - Secondary: Tool standardization

## Cross-Cutting Concerns
Some driving factors affect multiple categories and require a combination of remediation actions:

1. **Technical Debt**
   - Testing & Quality: Code improvements
   - Development Process: Debt sprints
   - Developer Experience: Tooling improvements

2. **Team Productivity**
   - Developer Experience: Automation
   - Culture & Process: Training
   - Development Process: Workflow improvements

3. **System Quality**
   - Testing & Quality: Test coverage
   - Observability & Monitoring: System visibility
   - Development Process: CI/CD improvements
