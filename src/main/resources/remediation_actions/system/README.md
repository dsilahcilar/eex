# System Remediation Actions

This directory contains remediation actions focused on system-level improvements. These actions address system reliability, performance, monitoring, and integration aspects.

## Structure
Each remediation action is defined in a YAML file with the following structure:
```yaml
id: unique_identifier
name: 'Action Name'
description: 'Detailed description'
type: 'system'
implementation_complexity: 'LOW|MEDIUM|HIGH'
time_investment: 'LOW|MEDIUM|HIGH'
cost_investment: 'LOW|MEDIUM|HIGH'

expected_outcomes:
  - 'Outcome 1'
  - 'Outcome 2'

implementation_steps:
  - 'Step 1'
  - 'Step 2'

success_metrics:
  - 'Metric 1'
  - 'Metric 2'

resources_needed:
  - 'Resource 1'
  - 'Resource 2'
```

## Available Actions
- **Performance Optimization**: System performance and resource utilization
- **Monitoring Infrastructure**: System observability and incident detection
- **Service Resilience Framework**: Service reliability and fault tolerance
- **Integration Testing Framework**: Service integration testing
- **System Reliability Program**: Overall system reliability and availability

## Relationships
The relationships between remediation actions and driving factors are defined in the driving factors' YAML files. Each relationship specifies:
- Whether it's a primary or secondary solution
- The impact level (HIGH/MEDIUM/LOW)
