# Technical Remediation Actions

This directory contains remediation actions focused on technical improvements and solutions. These actions address code quality, testing, architecture, and technical practices.

## Structure
Each remediation action is defined in a YAML file with the following structure:
```yaml
id: unique_identifier
name: 'Action Name'
description: 'Detailed description'
type: 'technical'
implementation_complexity: 'LOW|MEDIUM|HIGH'
time_investment: 'LOW|MEDIUM|HIGH'
cost_investment: 'LOW|MEDIUM|HIGH'

expected_outcomes:
  - 'Outcome 1'
  - 'Outcome 2'

implementation_steps:
  - 'Step 1'
  - 'Step 2'

success_metrics:
  - 'Metric 1'
  - 'Metric 2'

resources_needed:
  - 'Resource 1'
  - 'Resource 2'
```

## Available Actions
- **Testing Framework Enhancement**: Comprehensive testing practices and automation
- **Code Quality Initiative**: Code standards and best practices
- **Technical Debt Reduction**: Systematic debt reduction
- **Architecture Simplification**: System architecture improvement
- **Code Review Process**: Quality assurance and knowledge sharing
- **Contract Testing**: Service integration reliability
- **Feature Toggles**: Deployment risk management
- **Code Review Guidelines**: Code review standards and practices

## Relationships
The relationships between remediation actions and driving factors are defined in the driving factors' YAML files. Each relationship specifies:
- Whether it's a primary or secondary solution
- The impact level (HIGH/MEDIUM/LOW)
