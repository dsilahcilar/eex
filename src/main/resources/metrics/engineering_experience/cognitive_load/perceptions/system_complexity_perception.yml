description: 'Measures developers perception of system complexity and its impact on their cognitive load'
type: 'qualitative'
drivingFactors:
  - 'code_complexity'
  - 'technical_debt_burden'
relationships:
  leadingIndicators:
    - 'developer_satisfaction'
  laggingIndicators:
    - 'defect_density'

survey:
  question: 'How would you rate the cognitive load required to understand and work with the current system architecture?'
  options:
    - 'Very Low - System is well-structured and easy to understand'
    - 'Low - System is mostly clear with some complex areas'
    - 'Moderate - Requires significant effort to understand parts of the system'
    - 'High - System is complex and requires extensive mental mapping'
    - 'Very High - System is overly complex and difficult to reason about'
