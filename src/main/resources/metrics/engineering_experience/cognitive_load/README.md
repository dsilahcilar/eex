# Cognitive Load Metrics

This category contains metrics that measure and track the cognitive complexity and mental effort required by developers when working with the codebase.

## Overview
Cognitive load metrics help identify areas where developers might struggle with complexity, helping teams maintain a codebase that is easier to understand and maintain.

## Metrics Types

### Quantitative Metrics
- **Code Cognitive Complexity**: Measures the cognitive complexity of code based on factors like cyclomatic complexity, nesting levels, and code structure.

### Perception Metrics
- **System Complexity Perception**: Developers' perception of system complexity and its impact on their cognitive load
- **Code Clarity and Readability**: Measures perception of code readability and documentation quality
- **Deployment Process Ease**: Evaluates the perceived complexity of deployment processes

## Usage
These metrics are used to:
- Identify areas of high cognitive complexity that may need refactoring
- Track the effectiveness of code simplification efforts
- Guide architectural decisions to maintain manageable cognitive load
- Improve documentation and knowledge sharing practices
