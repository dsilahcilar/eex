  calculation: |
    Lead Time = Time from commit to production deployment

    Phases measured:
    1. Code Review Time: Commit to PR approval
    2. Build Time: PR merge to successful build
    3. Test Time: Build completion to test completion
    4. Deploy Time: Test completion to production deployment
    
    Total Lead Time = Sum of all phase durations
