This category focuses on measuring the operational performance and reliability of systems. These metrics help teams understand system health, stability, and efficiency.

## Metrics in this Category
- `deployment_frequency`: How often code is deployed to production
- `change_failure_rate`: Percentage of changes that result in degraded service
- `mean_time_to_recovery`: Time to restore service after an incident
- `system_availability`: Uptime and reliability measurements

## Related Driving Factors
