  calculation: |
    Availability = (Total Uptime / Total Time Period) * 100

    Where service is considered "down" if any of:
    - Service is completely unavailable
    - Error rate exceeds 0.1% of requests
    - Latency P95 exceeds defined SLO
    - Critical business functions are impaired
    
    Monthly calculation example:
    - Total minutes in month: 43,200 (30 days)
    - Total downtime minutes: 43
    - Availability = (43,157 / 43,200) * 100 = 99.9%

  error_budget:
    policy: |
      - Monthly error budget: 0.1% (43.2 minutes)
      - If error budget is exhausted:
        1. Freeze non-critical deployments
        2. Prioritize reliability improvements
        3. Review and update runbooks
        4. Conduct incident retrospectives
