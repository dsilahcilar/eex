# Process Efficiency Metrics

This category focuses on measuring the efficiency of development and delivery processes. These metrics help optimize workflows and identify bottlenecks.

## Metrics in this Category
- `lead_time_for_changes`: Time from code commit to production
- `cycle_time`: Time from work start to completion
- `release_frequency`: Frequency of production releases
- `process_compliance`: Adherence to defined processes
- `automation_coverage`: Extent of automated processes

## Related Driving Factors
- Release complexity
- Integration delays
- Manual process overhead
- Development workflow inefficiencies
- Deployment risk

## Frameworks
- **DORA**: Core metrics for process performance
- **SPACE**: Maps to Efficiency dimension
- **Lean**: Process efficiency principles

## Data Collection
- Version control systems
- CI/CD pipelines
- Project management tools
- Process automation tools
- Deployment tracking systems
